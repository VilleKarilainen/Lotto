The Lotto game
This is my first ever project using java, which I did for schoolwork. We  What the program does, is basically calculate how long it would take for you to win the lottery. The program asks the user the length of the lottery, or how many numbers will be asked, the range of numbers to be used, and in how many years must you win the lottery to win the game.
Initially the plan was to ask the user for exactly 7 unique numbers, ranging from 1 to 40, and the player beat the game if the lottery was won within a lifetime, or roughly 120 years. I decided to change the program so that the game so is customisable by the player.
Here ia how the code works:

In this step the parameters of the game are asked from the user.
